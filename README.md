# TicTacToe
An extension of a class project a few years ago that I will use to experiment with neural networks, and maybe make a functioning one.

  I'm going to try and figure out how genetic algorithms and neural networks work, and then try and implement that knowledge to make a neural network that can do really well at tic tac toe. Although it seems like it's a simple game that you almost always tie, I've found through manually making an AI that there's actually quite a bit of strategy that can be implemented. So we'll see how it goes. :D
